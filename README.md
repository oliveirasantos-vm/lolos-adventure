# lolos-adventure
The game to be programmed for this work consists of a simplification of the game Adventures of Lolo, released for the NES platform in 1989. In this game, the player controls Lolo, who must save Lala, trapped on top of a tower by monsters. Each stage of the game corresponds to a tower floor, where Lolo must defeat enemies and find the exit to the next floor.
